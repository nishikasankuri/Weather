I created a web application using React and Axios which gives weather information of the searched city.

Installation:
- Node.js
- Npm
- API key from OpenWeatherApp

Features:
- Real-time Weather
- Error handling
- Search by city
- Responsive design

Commands used:
- npm install
- nmp start
- npm build

Note: Use API from the OpenWeatherApp to get the current weather. Insert it in the variable "const api_key='' " in the file named App.js.
